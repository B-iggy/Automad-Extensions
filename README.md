# Automad-Extensions
A little collection of Extensions for [Automad](http://automad.org/) - written by me or friendly contributors?

## IMPORTANT NOTE

Because Automad is so configured that it takes automatically your css and js files within your extension folder and put it in the header or footer via @x(...)* I put the foundation files in automad/lib/. See here https://github.com/B-iggy/ignaz-biegler.de/tree/master/automad/lib/foundation-5.5.1
